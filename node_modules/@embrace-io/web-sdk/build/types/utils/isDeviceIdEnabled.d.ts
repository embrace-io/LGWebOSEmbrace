/**
 * Determines whether a deviceId is enabled for the given pctEnabled. This is achieved
 * by taking a normalized hex value from the last 6 digits of the device ID, and comparing
 * it against the enabled percentage. This ensures that devices are consistently in a given
 * group for beta functionality.
 *
 * This can be used to:
 * - Select sample devices for telemetry collection
 * - Enable/disable features for a percentage of users
 *
 * The normalized device ID has 16^6 possibilities (roughly 1.6m) which should be sufficient
 * granularity for our needs.
